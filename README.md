# HumanBenchmark-Old-Project
My first semester project, written in C# with WinForms.

The project was born in school half year into studying software development.
The idea was based around the website https://humanbenchmark.com/ but I also extended the program with a sorting algorithm visualizer

Sorting algorithm visualizer doesn't fit the whole concept, but it was interesting and challanging at the time so I added it.
